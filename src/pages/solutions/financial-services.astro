      <h2>What Empower AI Delivers</h2>
      <h3>Trustworthy AI Over Enterprise Data</h3>
      <p>Empower integrates with data warehouses, risk systems, core banking platforms, policy documents, regulatory rules, and customer service knowledge. It allows AI-driven intelligence without breaking governance, privacy, explainability, or compliance.</p>
      <h3>Epistemic Reasoning: No Hallucination</h3>
      <p>Every answer includes source citations, data lineage, business rules applied, regulatory constraints considered, and model provenance. Empower distinguishes validated financial facts from model-derived hypotheses and uncertain or incomplete information.</p>
      <h3>Multi-Graph Knowledge Fabric</h3>
      <p>Empower builds a three-graph epistemic model: a <strong>Domain Graph</strong> of validated entities (accounts, instruments, risk models, KPIs), a <strong>Subject Graph</strong> of LLM-extracted hypotheses (customer intents, fraud indicators, policy interpretations), and a <strong>Lexical Graph</strong> of immutable source-of-truth documents (regulatory filings, contracts, SOPs, disclosures).</p>
      <h3>Regulatory Alignment</h3>
      <p>Empower's epistemic architecture supports SEC, FINRA, SOX, OCC, CFPB, GDPR, and internal governance frameworks &mdash; delivering audit-traceable decision narratives across every interaction.</p>

      <h2>The Challenge for Financial Institutions</h2>
      <div class="challenge-grid">
        <div class="card fade-in">
          <h3>Heavy Regulation</h3>
          <p>SEC, FINRA, OCC, CFPB, and SOX requirements constrain every technology deployment. Generic AI tools lack the governance infrastructure to operate safely in this environment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card fade-in">
          <h3>Data Complexity at Scale</h3>
          <p>Petabyte-scale warehouses, fragmented systems, and legacy platforms make cross-domain insights difficult. Traditional analytics require manual reconciliation across disconnected data models.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card fade-in">
          <h3>Legacy Modernization Pressure</h3>
          <p>Banks and insurers must modernize without disrupting operations. Rip-and-replace is not an option &mdash; new AI capabilities must layer onto existing infrastructure.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card fade-in">
          <h3>Ungoverned AI Risk</h3>
          <p>Hallucination-prone LLMs, opaque model behavior, and black-box automation create compliance exposure. Risk teams routinely block GenAI pilots that lack explainability and audit trails.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card fade-in">
          <h3>Metric Inconsistency</h3>
          <p>KPI definitions vary across business units, teams, and tools. Slightly different definitions produce conflicting numbers &mdash; eroding executive trust and complicating regulatory reporting.</p>

        <h2>Priority Use Cases</h2>
        <h3>Customer Service &amp; Contact Centers</h3>
        <p>Intelligent case summarization, policy-accurate explanations, complaint interpretation with evidence-linked reasoning, and error-proofing of agent responses. <strong>Impact:</strong> Faster resolution, reduced escalations, improved CSAT.</p>
        <h3>Wealth &amp; Advisory</h3>
        <p>Explain investment recommendations using regulatory-compliant language. Map client questions to validated financial concepts. Ensure consistent definitions of risk scores, allocations, and product profiles. <strong>Impact:</strong> Advisor productivity + regulatory defensibility.</p>
        <h3>Fraud Analysis &amp; Risk</h3>
        <p>Detect contradictions, connect patterns across transactions and documents, and generate reasoning trails for suspicious activity. <strong>Impact:</strong> Reduced investigation time, improved risk insights.</p>
        <h3>Insurance Claims</h3>
        <p>Deterministic interpretation of coverage rules, evidence-linked reasoning for approvals and denials, and consistent application of policy language. <strong>Impact:</strong> Consistency, fairness, auditability.</p>
        <h3>Lending &amp; Credit</h3>
        <p>Interpret underwriting guidelines, translate credit decisions into explainable narratives, and validate model-driven decisions against policy constraints. <strong>Impact:</strong> Transparent, compliant decisioning.</p>
        <h3>Governance &amp; Compliance</h3>
        <p>Model Risk Management, documentation intelligence, compliance Q&amp;A, control adherence verification, and regulatory reporting workflows. <strong>Impact:</strong> Lower risk, fewer findings, faster audits.</p>
        <h3>Analytics: Safe Semantic Layer</h3>
        <p>Natural-language analytics that cannot bypass governance. Metric definitions resolved through the Domain Graph. SQL and BI explanations with full lineage. <strong>Impact:</strong> Safe self-service BI, reduced data engineering load.</p>
