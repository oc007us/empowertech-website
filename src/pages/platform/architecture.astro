        <h2>Horizontal Core, Vertical Packs</h2>
        <p>The architecture separates the universal platform core from vertical-specific customization — the foundational design principle that enables Empower AI to serve any enterprise domain from a single governed runtime.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>One governed runtime for any enterprise domain</strong> — The horizontal core provides the knowledge fabric, reasoning engine, governance framework, and execution layer.</li>
          <li><strong>Vertical Packs</strong> define domain-specific semantics (ontologies and taxonomies), policies (rules and constraints), actions (system integrations), plays (workflow patterns), evaluations (quality metrics), and UX (user-facing interfaces).</li>
          <li><strong>Ship new verticals by packaging — not rewiring the platform.</strong> Each new industry or use case is a configuration, not a rebuild.</li>
        </ul>

          <h2>Semantic Knowledge Fabric</h2>
          <p>The Semantic Knowledge Fabric is the grounding layer that gives Empower AI its ability to understand — not just retrieve.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ontology-grounded semantic graph</strong> — Domain knowledge is represented as structured ontologies, not flat text chunks.</li>
            <li><strong>Entity resolution</strong> — Shared meaning across sources. The system resolves entities across disparate datasets to create a unified representation.</li>
            <li><strong>Temporal truth and provenance</strong> — Every fact carries its source, timestamp, and lineage.</li>
            <li><strong>Fact resolution across sources</strong> — When sources contain conflicting information, the knowledge fabric resolves contradictions through provenance-aware reasoning.</li>

        <h2>The Decision Trace Pipeline</h2>
        <p>Empower AI does not bolt on explainability after the fact. Every recommendation, decision, and action is explainable by construction.</p>
        <p>Every action carries a complete trace:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Trigger</strong> — What initiated the decision (user query, scheduled task, event, or upstream agent)</li>
          <li><strong>Context</strong> — The knowledge, data, and state the system considered</li>
          <li><strong>Evidence</strong> — Specific sources, citations, and data points that support the conclusion</li>
          <li><strong>Policy</strong> — Which governance rules and constraints were applied</li>
          <li><strong>Approvals</strong> — Who reviewed and approved (human or automated gate)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This trace is replayable and auditable by default. Any decision can be reconstructed to show exactly what the system saw, how it reasoned, and why it reached its conclusion.</p>

          <h2>Knowledge Accretion: The Compounding Advantage</h2>
          <p>Unlike systems that start from zero with every query, Empower AI accumulates institutional knowledge over time.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Outcomes feed back</strong> into precedent and policy refinement. Each resolved case enriches the platform's understanding.</li>
            <li><strong>Better decisions over time — measurably.</strong> The system tracks decision quality and uses outcomes to improve future reasoning.</li>
            <li><strong>Institutional knowledge becomes searchable and reusable.</strong> Tribal expertise, historical decisions, and domain-specific patterns are captured and preserved.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This creates a compounding advantage: the longer the platform operates, the more valuable it becomes.</p>

        <h2>Governance and Provenance</h2>
        <p>Enterprise AI requires governance that scales with autonomy. Empower AI provides:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Versioned ontology, policy, action contracts, and evaluation suites</strong> — Every component is versioned and tracked.</li>
          <li><strong>Signed changes and audit trails</strong> — For compliance readiness across regulated industries (GxP, HIPAA, CMS, FDA).</li>
          <li><strong>Safe evolution without breaking production autonomy</strong> — Updates are managed through controlled releases.</li>

          <h2>Multi-Agent Orchestration</h2>
          <p>Empower AI uses a specialist-agent architecture rather than monolithic models.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Orchestrator routes tasks to specialist agents</strong> — Each agent handles a specific capability: retrieval, policy evaluation, planning, execution, or verification.</li>
            <li><strong>Separation of duties</strong> — Decomposing complex tasks into specialized steps reduces hallucinations and increases reliability.</li>
            <li><strong>Composable agent pipelines</strong> — New capabilities are added by composing agents, not by retraining or rebuilding.</li>

        <h2>Enterprise Integration: Read and Write</h2>
        <p>Empower AI is not limited to answering questions — it safely interacts with enterprise systems.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Canonical enterprise layer</strong> — Normalizes data and operations across disparate systems (CRM, ERP, QMS, LIMS, CTMS, ticketing, and more).</li>
          <li><strong>Typed Action Registry</strong> — Safe connectors with defined contracts for every write-back operation.</li>
          <li><strong>Idempotent, verifiable, and reversible writes</strong> — Write-backs use diffs, idempotency keys, and verification checks.</li>
          <li><strong>Policy gates, approvals, and exception routing</strong> — Every action passes through governance checks before execution.</li>
